### Project
The initial goal of the project is to provide a service for saving Twitter threads outside the platform, so that they can be easily shared in one big message on a dedicated website.
The site should be static and the project should be easy to host without taking up too much resources or storage in order to reduce hosting costs as much as possible to guarantee a free service, and without ads.
